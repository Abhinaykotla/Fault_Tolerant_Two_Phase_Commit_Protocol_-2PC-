# Fault_Tolerant_Two_Phase_Commit_Protocol_-2PC-
This project demonstrates a fault-tolerant implementation of the Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC) in a distributed system using Python. The project is divided into four parts, each progressively introducing additional failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms to evaluate the robustness of the protocol.
